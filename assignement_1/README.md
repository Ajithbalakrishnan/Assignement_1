
C++ output and pytorch outputs are not the same


I have applied various methods to make it aligned,


    1. Manual seeding on both implementations.

    
    2. uniform initialization of weights and bias.

    
    3. same normalization method on both side.

    
    4. difference in datatypes between c++ and python also tried to address. This need to be evaluated.

    

The difference between datatypes of pytorch and c++ can be a problem.
